                    <p>
                        If you have consented to data processing, we will process your personal data on the basis of
                        Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR if special categories of data are processed in
                        accordance with Art. 9 (1) GDPR. In the case of an explicit consent to the transfer of personal
                        data to third countries, the data processing will also be carried out on the basis of Art. 49
                        (1) (a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access information in your
                        device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), the data processing will also be carried out on the
                        basis of Section 25 (1) TDDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required
                        to fulfill the contract or to carry out pre-contractual measures, we will process your data on
                        the basis of Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is required to fulfill

                        on the basis of our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The relevant
                        legal bases in each individual case are provided in the following paragraphs of this data
                        protection declaration.

                    <p>
                        As part of our business activities, we work with various external bodies. In some cases, this
                        also requires the transmission of personal data to these external bodies.
                        We only pass on personal data to external bodies if this is necessary to fulfill a contract, if
                        we are legally obliged to do so (e.g. passing on data
                        to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the transfer pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1
                        lit. f GDPR or if another legal basis allows the data to be passed on. When using
                        contract processors, we only pass on our customers' personal data on the basis of a valid
                        contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing
                        is concluded.

                        revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.

                        Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to
                        obtain free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the
                        purpose of data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data.
                        You can contact us at any time about this and other questions on the subject of personal data.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        You have the right to request that the processing of your personal data be restricted. You can
                        contact us at any time to do so. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:
                        <br>
                    <ul>
                        If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to check
                        this. For the duration of the check, you have the right to request that the processing of your
                        personal data be restricted.
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request that the data
                        processing be restricted instead of deleted.
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal
                        claims, you have the right to request that the processing of your personal data be restricted
                        instead of being deleted.
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        If you have lodged an objection in accordance with Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be
                        struck between your interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail,
                        you have the right to request that the processing of your personal data be restricted.
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data - apart from its storage -
                    may only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal
                    claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important
                    public interest of the European Union or a member state.
