                    <p>
                        <a href="">Join</a> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of
                        dedicated
                        students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.<br><br>

                        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
                        limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <a href="">Join</a> leverages the
                        principles of
                        kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.<br><br>

                    <h2>How to use it</h3>
                        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <a href="">Join</a>:</p>
                        <div>
                            <h2>1.</h2>
                            <p>
                            <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                            When you log in to <a href="">Join</a>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project
                            and
                            contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h2>2.</h2>
                            <p>
                            <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                            In <a href="">Join</a>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts"
                            section,
                            click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts
                            can
                            be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h2>3.</h2>
                            <p>
                            <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                            Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                            individual
                            tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                            task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h2>4.</h2>
                            <p>
                            <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                            As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by
                            dragging
                            and dropping the card from one list to another.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h2>5.</h2>
                            <p>
                            <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                            Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                            Deleting a
                            card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting
                            cards,
                            as this action is irreversible.<br><br>
